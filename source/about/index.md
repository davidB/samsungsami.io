# A PLATFORM FOR HEALTH INNOVATION

Samsung launched a bold initiative aimed at directing the resources and innovation of the global technology industry toward empowering individuals to better manage their own health and wellness. The Samsung Digital Health Initiative is based on open hardware and software platforms that will accelerate the development of advanced sensors, algorithms, and data collection and analysis.

Samsung’s Simband is an open hardware reference design for wearable technology, capable of integrating the most advanced sensing technologies in the world. Innovators are invited to use the reference platform to create and contribute their own advanced sensors, algorithms and other technologies.

The Samsung Architecture for Multimodal Interactions (SAMI) is a cloud-based open software platform capable of bringing together diverse data from a variety of sources for analysis. It will allow devices and sensors to securely store data in the cloud regardless of the source’s format or structure. SAMI’s job is to make more information available, to break open information silos and give applications and services access to large amounts of data to provide better insights.

The combination of Simband-designed sensor technologies and algorithms and SAMI-based software will take individual understanding of the body to a new level – for the first time giving voice to a deeper understanding of personal health and wellness. In addition, through the development of new sensing technologies and software, it’s possible that entirely new and previously unimagined insights into health and wellness could be generated.
