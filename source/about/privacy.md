##Samsung Simband/SAMIIO Platform Privacy Policy

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its affiliates (“Samsung,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know how important privacy is to our customers, and we strive to be clear about how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information.  This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) provides an overview of our information practices.  The Privacy Policy applies to (i) the Samsung Simband/SAMIIO Platform, a platform operated by Samsung that will enable mobile devices like those based on Simband to upload information, (ii) the following SAMIIO websites:  portal.samsungsami.io (the “User Portal”), devportal.samsungsami.io (the “Developer Portal”), trial-admin.samsungsami.io (the “Trial Tool Administrator Site”) and trial.samsungsami.io (the “Trial Tool Participant Site”), go.simband.io, and (iii) any Samsung device, website or online application that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Platform”).

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies regardless of whether you use a computer, mobile phone, tablet, TV, or other device to access the Platform.  It is important that you read the Privacy Policy carefully because anytime you use the Platform, you consent to the practices we describe in the Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the practices described in the Privacy Policy, you should not use the Platform.

It also is important that you check back often for updates to the Privacy Policy.  If we update the Privacy Policy, we will let you know about our changes we consider material by placing a note on the relevant web page you use to access the Platform services.  By accessing or using the Platform after we have placed such a notice, you consent to the new practice(s) identified in the update.  The most current version of the Privacy Policy will always be available on www.voiceofthebody.io/privacy.  You can check the “effective date” posted at the top to see when the Privacy Policy was last updated.

##What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy covers how Samsung treats personally identifiable information that it collects and receives through the Platform.  “Personal Information” means information about you that is personally identifiable (e.g., your name, address, email address or phone number) and not otherwise publicly available.

##What Information Do We Collect About You?
We do not collect Personal Information about you through the Platform without your knowledge or action.  We use Personal Information that we collect to (i) provide the Platform services you request and (ii) understand the way you use the Platform services so that we can improve your experience.  Your information is collected and used in the following ways through the Platform.

***The Platform.***  Samsung operates the Platform, which offers an interface that allows cloud-based services to store and exchange data from diverse devices such as, but not limited to, Simband.  The Platform exposes application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable developers to store or read data from devices, services and mobile applications.  The Personal Information collected through the APIs and hosted on the Platform’s cloud servers may include, but is not limited to, name and other demographic information of the user and biometric health data recorded by the third party service, Simband or other device.  The Personal Information collected through the Platform is used to offer the Platform’s services, including to users of mobile devices based on Simband.  Personal Information stored through the Platform may include medical information if a user has chosen to store such information.

***Platform Websites.***  Samsung offers various products and services on websites associated with the Platform, including the User Portal, the Developer Portal, the Trial Tool Administrator Site and the Trial Tool Site.  Personal Information is collected through the registration forms of the Platform websites, and may include, but is not limited to, name, phone number, fax number, email address and, if applicable, credit card information.  The Personal Information collected through the Platform websites is used to offer the particular products and services available through the Platform.

***Information About Your Use of the Platform.***   In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information about your use of the Platform, such as the applications and devices you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content offered through a Platform service.

***Other Information We Collect.***  We also may collect other information about you, your device(s), or your use of the Platform in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent.

##To Whom Do We Disclose Your Information?
Except as described below and in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information to any third parties without your consent. 
 	
***Disclosures to Certain Third Parties.***  We may disclose your Personal Information to our subcontractors or agents that we contract with to assist us in providing the Platform; provided that any such subcontractors or agents shall agree in writing to comply with the privacy and security standards described in this Privacy Policy.

***Disclosures Under Special Circumstances.***  There may be instances when we disclose your Personal Information to other parties:

* to comply with the law or respond to compulsory legal process (such as a search warrant or court order);
* to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing the Platform; or
* to protect the rights, property or safety of Samsung, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, or customers.

***Other Parties in Connection With Corporate Transactions.***  We may disclose your information to a third party as part of a merger or transfer, or in the event of a bankruptcy.

***Other Parties With Your Consent or At Your Direction.***  In addition to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties when you consent to or request such sharing.

##Automatically Collected Information And Anonymous Information

***Aggregated Data.***  Samsung collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and also counts, tracks, and aggregates the visitor's activity into Samsung’s analysis of general traffic-flow through the Platform.  To these ends, Samsung may merge information about you into aggregated group data.  In some cases, Samsung may remove personal identifiers from Personal Information and maintain it in aggregate form that may later be combined with other information to generate anonymous, aggregated statistical information. Such anonymous, group data may be shared on an aggregated basis with Samsung’s affiliates, business partners, service providers and/or vendors; if it does so, Samsung will not disclose your individual identity. 

***Web Server Logs and IP Addresses.***  An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number that automatically identifies the computer/machine you have used to access the Internet. The IP address enables our server to send you the web pages that you want to visit, and it may disclose the server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Samsung may use IP addresses to conduct website analyses and performance reviews and to administer the Platform.

***Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies.***  We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our services.

***Cookies***.  Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

* Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
* Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the services and provide you with a better experience.
* Cookies help us provide you with relevant content by collecting information about your use of the Platform and other websites and apps.

When you use a web browser to access a website, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies.

Please note, however, that some services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those services, or certain parts of them.

**Other Local Storage**.  We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here: [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html).

**Beacons**.  We also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We may use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Platform and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content that is more relevant to you.

**_By accessing and using the Platform, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices. You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us._** 

##Security
Samsung understands that storing data in a secure manner is essential. Samsung stores Personal Information and other data using reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards to secure data against foreseeable risks, such as unauthorized use, access, disclosure, destruction or modification.  Although we make good faith efforts to store the information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Further, while we work to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.

##Links To Other Websites
Our Platform services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control.  We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by such websites or other services.  You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.
We also make available to you certain products or services (e.g., apps available through the Platform) developed by third parties.  Samsung is not responsible for these third-party products or services.

##Children’s Privacy Protection

###Under Age 13
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

###Under Age 18
Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Information that they have provided to Samsung while using the Platform deleted by sending an email to VOTB@ssi.samsung.com requesting deletion.  Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems. 

##Do Not Track Signals And Similar Mechanisms
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Samsung currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

##Correcting, Updating Or Deleting Information
The Platform gives users the option to correct, update or delete information previously provided to us by the user; however, we will maintain copies of user information to the extent retained as part of the Platform’s standard backup/archive process.
