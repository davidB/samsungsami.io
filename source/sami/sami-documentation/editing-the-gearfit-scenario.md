# Editing the Gear Fit scenario

In Step 3 of the [**Hello, World!**](/sami/sami-documentation/hello-world.html) guide, you have used the `gs` command to create a scenario file for a "SAMI Gear Fit" device type. By default, the file uses random values to simulate data. You might, however, like the generated data to make sense for the device type.

Open the JSON file using your preferred text editor and replace its contents with the below JSON code ***except for `sdid`***, which should be unchanged in your file. The `sdid` in your file is from the first input argument (`did`) of the command `gs` that you executed.

`sdid` is the source device ID of the device sending data to SAMI. It is a unique string generated by SAMI when the device is first connected.

Take a moment to understand some important source lines:

- **Line 5:** `data`{:.param} contains default values that will be overwritten by the parameters below it.
- **Line 12:** [`config`{:.param}](/sami/demos-tools/device-simulator.html#the-config-object) calculates the values for each field on each simulation loop.
- **Lines 32 and 33:** `min`{:.param} and `max`{:.param} values for Gear Fit represent not-wearing (0) and wearing (1) states.
- **Line 40:** Gear Fit reports activities as a number `value`{:.param}, e.g., walk (1), run (2), unknown (0).
- **Line 43:** `period`{:.param} is the main simulation clock, in milliseconds. The Simulator sends one message to SAMI every 1 second.

Save the modified JSON scenario file and start the simulation with this scenario! [Learn more](http://developer.samsungsami.io/sami/demos-tools/device-simulator.html#scenarios) about configuring the scenario file for device simulation.
