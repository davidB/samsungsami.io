# Connect the data

SAMI is a powerful and flexible data broker. Once you understand [the Manifest](/sami/sami-documentation/the-manifest.html), read this section to learn how to send and receive data between SAMI and applications, devices and third-party clouds.

* [Circulating data](/sami/connect-the-data/rest-and-websockets.html) between applications, devices and SAMI using REST and WebSockets APIs. 
* Using SAMI as a message broker for connected devices in an [MQTT session](/sami/connect-the-data/mqtt.html).
* [Rate limits](/sami/connect-the-data/rate-limiting.html) on REST, WebSockets and MQTT APIs.
* [Writing Rules](/sami/connect-the-data/develop-rules-for-devices.html) that make devices work together.
* Setting up [subscriptions and notifications](/sami/connect-the-data/subscribe-and-notify.html) to listen to relevant messages and Actions.
* Building a [Cloud Connector](/sami/connect-the-data/using-cloud-connectors.html) to enable SAMI to communicate with third-party clouds.
