# Tools

The following tools were created to make working with SAMI as easy and intuitive as it can be. Suggestions for features or improvements are welcome!

- Using the [Developer Portal and User Portal](/sami/tools/developer-user-portals.html) to manage devices, device types and applications.
- The SAMI [API Console](/sami/tools/api-console.html), where you can test the SAMI APIs and preview the results.
- [Native SDKs](/sami/tools/native-SDKs/) designed to help you integrate SAMI with your language of choice.
- The [device simulator](/sami/tools/device-simulator.html), a development tool for sending messages to SAMI on behalf of devices.
