Here we'll be posting regular updates about SAMI and updates to the documentation.

### April 18, 2015

Some things for you to play with! A [JavaScript/Node.js demo](/sami/samples/) that shows user devices and device data, and our new [Python 3 SDK](/sami/native-SDKs/).

### April 17, 2015

Token refresh flow is now described in [Authentication](/sami/sami-documentation/authentication.html#refresh-a-token).

### April 1, 2015

We just documented [secure device registration](/sami/sami-documentation/secure-your-devices.html) for creating secure device types and registering devices with SAMI for secure communication. (No joke!)

The article [Data collection with trials](/sami/sami-documentation/data-collection-with-trials.html) highlights some key APIs for conducting trials programmatically.

### March 23, 2015

We have added new documentation on writing a [Manifest with Actions](/sami/sami-documentation/the-manifest.html#manifests-that-support-actions) for devices. New "description" and "actions" parameters are returned when [getting Manifest properties](/sami/api-spec.html#get-manifest-properties) with the API.

### March 20, 2015

The API spec has been updated with [Trials APIs](/sami/api-spec.html#trials) and updates to the [Export API](/sami/api-spec.html#export), including "simple" CSV data exports. The [API Console](https://api-console.samsungsami.io) is also updated to reflect these changes and additions.

### January 31, 2015

### December 17, 2014

[Rate limiting](/sami/sami-documentation/rate-limiting.html) is now documented.

### December 16, 2014

The beta starts today! Dig around the [documentation](/sami/sami-documentation/), play with the [APIs and tools](/sami/demos-tools/), and [post any questions](/community/) you might have. We're looking forward to your feedback.
