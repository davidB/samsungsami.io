#PHP SDK (alpha)

This SDK helps you connect your PHP scripts to SAMI. The SDK helps authenticating with SAMI, exposes a number of methods to easily execute REST API calls to SAMI and supports WebSockets.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 5.3 or higher
- [cURL library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) for PHP

The PHP SDK was tested with version 5.4.

### Source code

The source code for the PHP SDK is located [on GitHub.](https://github.com/samiio/sami-php)

## Installation

No specific installation process is required. Add the scripts to your project and start using SAMI.

## Usage

The easiest way to start using the SAMI PHP SDK is to look at our demo scripts. These will give you a good overview of what you can do, and how to do it. Read more at [https://github.com/samiio/sami-php-demo](https://github.com/samiio/sami-php-demo).
