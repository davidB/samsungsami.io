#Ruby SDK (beta)

This SDK helps you connect your Ruby scripts to SAMI. The SDK helps authenticating with SAMI, exposes a number of methods to easily execute REST API calls to SAMI and supports WebSockets.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby >= 1.9.3

### Source code

The source code for the PHP SDK is located [on GitHub.](https://github.com/samsungsamiio/sami-ruby)

## Installation

No specific installation process is required. Add the scripts to your project and start using SAMI.

## Usage
The easiest way to start using the SAMI Ruby SDK is to look at our demo application at [https://github.com/samsungsamiio/sami-ruby-demo.](https://github.com/samsungsamiio/sami-ruby-demo)
